# Heart Disease Classification ML Model

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to classify heart disease presence based on various health metrics. The model uses techniques such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM, optimized through Randomized and Grid Search CV to find the best parameters. Evaluation is performed using classification metrics, including ROC curves, to ensure robust performance and accuracy. 

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Multiple classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning with Randomized and Grid Search CV
- Model evaluation with classification metrics
- Visualization of results with ROC curves
